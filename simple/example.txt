Some simple examples
====================

Here is a simple example.  Start shell commands like so.
``.. shell start``

.. shell start

Now, any commands after a ``^::`` will be recorded into a shell script.

For example, this will create FILE1:
::

   touch FILE1

In this next case, however, we want to say something verbatim without having
it executed.  Easy! Just don't put the ``::`` at the beginning of a line::

   rm FILE1

If you want to put in code that doesn't appear in the documentation, but
*does* get executed, put in a commented-out verbatim with ``.. ::`` and
then indent lines as normal afterwards.

.. ::

   touch FILE3

Let's turn off shell commands for a bit... with ``.. shell stop``

.. shell stop

Then these following commands will not be executed, even tho they are
in a verbatim block with ``::`` starting at the beginning of the line:
::

   touch FILE2

And, finally, we can turn shell commands back on with ``.. shell start``,
and go about our way.

.. shell start

::

   touch FILE4
   rm FILE1
